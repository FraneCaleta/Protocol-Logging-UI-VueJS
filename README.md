# User interface for protocol logging

User interface that uses Vue JavaScript framework and helps us to record requests/responses of different protocols as easily and efficiently as possible after performing automated test cases.

### Usage:
Clone this repository and open "protocols.html" in the browser.<br />
From there you can check some of the nicely displayed dummy protocol logs.
